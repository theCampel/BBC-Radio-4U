# BBC-Radio-4U

BBC-Radio-4U is an interactive audio application that generates and plays dialogues based on news articles and music tracks. It uses OpenAI's text-to-speech capabilities to create a dynamic audio experience with real-time visualisation.

## Features

- **News Article Processing**: Select and process news articles to generate dialogues.
- **Music Integration**: Integrates with Spotify to play random top songs.
- **Dynamic Dialogue Generation**: Uses OpenAI to generate dialogues based on news and music context.
- **Real-time Audio Visualisation**: Visualises audio playback with a dynamic sine wave animation.

## Running it yourself

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Make sure you have a `.env` file with all relevant keys (OpenAI, Spotify (you'll have to set this up), etc.)
4. Run the script (`python main.py` lol)
